# OneAPI-Workshop
This project aims to introduce Intel MKL, Intel Distribution for Python with highly optimized scikit-learn and Intel VTune as tools to further optimize computationally intense operations in scientific computing and machine learning workloads; specifically in use in larger scale systems such as high performance computing.
